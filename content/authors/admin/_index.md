I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Princeton Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu/) and a Research Fellow at Harvard's [Growth Lab](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/). My fields of research are Political Economy and Development Economics. My work leverages advanced quantitative methods to study the political causes and consequences of some of today's most pressing development issues - inequality, violence, trade and growth. I have a PhD in Public Policy from Harvard University. I will join [Texas A&M's Bush School of Government and Public Service](https://bush.tamu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the Fall of 2023.

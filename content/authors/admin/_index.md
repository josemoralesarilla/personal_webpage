I am a Research Professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey's [Graduate School of Government and Public Transformation](https://egobiernoytp.tec.mx/es). My fields of research are Political Economy and Development Economics. My work leverages advanced quantitative methods to study the political causes and consequences of some of today's most pressing development issues - inequality, violence, trade, migration and growth. I have a PhD in Public Policy from Harvard University, and pursued postdoctoral research at [Princeton Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu/) and Harvard's [Growth Lab](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in [Texas A&M's Bush School of Government and Public Service](https://bush.tamu.edu/).
